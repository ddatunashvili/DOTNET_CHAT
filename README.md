## Customization

* To change the database file location, update your connection string in `appsettings.json`.
* You can modify the SignalR hub logic in `ChatHub.cs` to add new real-time features.

## Troubleshooting

* If migrations fail due to existing migrations, consider deleting the `app.db` SQLite file and the Migrations folder, then recreate migrations.
* Ensure connection strings are correct and SQLite dependencies are installed.
